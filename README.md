# NFL_Kicking_Analysis
Data from: https://github.com/nflverse/nflfastR-data/tree/master/data/player_stats_kicking

## Overview
Analysis on NFL kicks since 1999. Created odds of making a kick from each distance based on historical data. Then placed a bet on each kick and calculated profits/losses for each kicker/team. 

Also used polynomial regression to fit historical data and create a second set of odds. Going to place bets for each kick and calculate profits/losses. Going to test r^2 for each individual season.

Going to perform logistic regression from all years and then test fit for each year as well as place bets.
